# hopital-challenge-Graven-24h

This is my work for the Graven Challenge in 24h.

I produced this project after around 8hours of coding.

Only the HTML was provided, also some ressources.

So i added the style.css, the app.js and more ressources.

My goal was to being able to produce the website full page with a modern design.
